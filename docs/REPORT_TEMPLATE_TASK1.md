# Task 1 Report: Repository Setup and Version Control

## Branching Strategy

[Explain your branching strategy here]

I implemented a Git Flow branching strategy for this project:

- **main branch**: Contains production-ready code that is deployed to GitHub Pages
- **development branch**: Integration branch where features are merged before going to production
- **feature branches**: Individual branches for specific features (e.g., feature/blog-section, feature/contact-form)

This strategy allows for:
- Isolated development of features without affecting the main codebase
- Easy rollback if issues are discovered
- Clear separation between development and production code
- Collaborative development where multiple features can be worked on simultaneously

## Technology Stack Choice

[Explain why you chose your tech stack]

I chose a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack for the following reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: Static sites are easy to deploy and maintain without backend infrastructure
2. **Performance**: Static files load faster and require minimal server resources
3. **Cost-effective**: Can be hosted for free on GitHub Pages
4. **DevOps Focus**: Allows me to focus on DevOps practices (CI/CD, containerization, monitoring) rather than complex application logic
5. **Portability**: Easy to containerize and deploy anywhere

The stack includes:
- HTML5 for semantic structure
- CSS3 for modern styling and responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (no framework overhead)
- Nginx in Docker for production serving

## DevOps Skills Demonstrated

[List and explain the DevOps skills you demonstrated]

Through this task, I demonstrated the following DevOps skills:

1. **Version Control**: Proper use of Git with meaningful commit messages and branching strategy
2. **Repository Management**: Organized folder structure with clear separation of concerns
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and setup guides
4. **Configuration Management**: Proper .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files
5. **Collaboration Readiness**: Repository structure supports team collaboration
6. **Best Practices**: Following industry standards for project organization

These foundational skills are essential for any DevOps engineer and demonstrate my understanding of version control workflows and collaborative development practices.
